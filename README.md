# Adaptative-Absorber-Denoise-Filter-using-CUDA

This test software is supposed to allow you to test my noise removal function (AADF) based on Python & CUDA.

This filter works only with video because it needs at least 2 consecutives images (N-1 and N) to perform noise removal.

You will need a NVIDIA GPU to run this program.
